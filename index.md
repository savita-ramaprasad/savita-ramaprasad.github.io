# Hi! I'm Savita  
I am a PhD in Econometrics (expected Summer 2018) actively looking for data science positions in the San Francisco Bay Area.  

Here's my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume_savita.pdf). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/savitaramaprasad/) and [Github](https://github.com/savitaramaprasad/). 
<!-- You can email at [first-name].tungu@gmail.com. -->

My doctoral research at [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/)
involves using econometric and statistical techniques to draw causal
inferences from observational data on the effect of policies and
quasi-experiments on various social outcomes. You can read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link research.md %}).

I received my undergraduate degree from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).

I have worked on a bunch of data science projects. You can read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link projects.md %}) and take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/savitaramaprasad/data-science-challenges).
