I am an Econometrics PhD candidate (expected 2018) at the
[University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/).  
I received my undergraduate degree from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).

My doctoral research
involves using econometric and statistical techniques to draw causal
inferences from observational data on the effect of policies and
quasi-experiments on various social outcomes. You can read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link research.md %}).

I have worked on a bunch of data science projects. You can read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link projects.md %}) and take a look at the code on [Github](https://github.com/savitaramaprasad/data-science-challenges).
 
I'm also actively looking for full-time data science positions in the San Francisco Bay Area. You can get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/savitaramaprasad/) or via email at [first-name].tungu@gmail.com
