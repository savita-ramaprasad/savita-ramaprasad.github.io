#### [Ride-share and motor-vehicle crashes]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link research/ride-share-and-motor-vehicle-crashes.pdf %})  

Abstract: Expansion of ridesharing technology in US cities is changing the way people travel from place to place. Using city-level data in Illinois from 2006 through 2016, this paper investigates whether the introduction of ridesharing services is associated with changes in various measures of motor vehicle crashes. I find that rideshare entry is associated with a decrease of 0.063 in nighttime fatal crash rate.
